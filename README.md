# RNG CHAOS SCROLL

Chaotic systems are deterministic and bounded in phase space, 
but they have positive Lyapunov exponents leading to completely 
divergent signals even for very small perturbations in initial conditions. 
Therefore, chaotic oscillators are frequently employed in Random Number Generator(RNG) 
applications where repeatable, secure and high-performance entropy sources are required. 
Chaotic oscillators can be implemented in either analog or digital circuits, 
but chaotic oscillators implemented in the digital domain are preferable for ease of 
integration to digital systems. In this study, a digital RNG based on chaotic oscillators 
was implemented using the SKY130 process node.
